# whatever info i am writing here, it actually creates a docker image.
# That docker image can be taken and can be run within a container.
# That container will interact with kernel of our operating system (not like Virtual Machine)
# helps: run a app in linux machine which was developed in a windows machine
FROM python:3.7 
# this line takes base image (say linux base image) from docker hub 
COPY . /app
# copy the contents from current location/repository to location/folder called "app" created in base image
WORKDIR /app
# that "app" in base image will be our working directory now
RUN pip install -r project_requirements.txt
# install all dependencies
EXPOSE $PORT
# $ is a place holder. When the docker image is run as a container, inorder to access the application inside conatiner, we have expose some port within the container.
# that means, after deployment into a cloud server, the server automatically assigns port in that container
CMD gunicorn --workers=4 --bind 0.0.0.0:$PORT app:app
# run the application
# gunicorn helps to run app in heroku cloud
# 0.0.0.0 is local IP address.
